##### This is a pig dice game.

#### By _** Rachael Berecka and Yelena Nedelko**_

## Description

_Two users, one pig and one skunk, play against each other in this probability game of nerves and luck. First player whose total score reaches 100 wins. Will there be tears? Will there be curses? Who knows?! But there will be cuteness. Lots of cuteness.
Pig starts the game. This is important! Follow this instruction or all is lost.
Pig choses to roll the dice. They can then chose to hold those points, add them to their total points and end their turn. Or they can roll again to increase their turn points. BEWARE! If pig rolls a 1 they get no points and lose their turn. Skunk then goes. This repeats until someone totals 100 points._
